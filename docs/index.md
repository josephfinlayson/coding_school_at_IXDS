## Mon 26-09-2016 - Session 7

Lesson plan:

* Review chapter three of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#program_structure)

#### Homework:

* Finish chapter 3 last exercise: 
  > Next, write a function called countChar that behaves like countBs, except it takes a second argument that indicates the character that is to be counted (rather than counting only uppercase “B” characters). Rewrite countBs to make use of this new function.

* **Read and do exercises of chapter four** of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
* Special for Gloria and anyone else who is interested, expand twitter example with real tweets from twitter
    * Download this [repository](https://github.com/josephfinlayson/client-side-oauth-example)
    * open it on your local machine
    * see tweets coming out in the console
    * register your app with twitter
    * change public key in app (see code for where)
    * incorporate code into your existing library, render tweets into HTML using jQuery
    * Take over world!
    
## Mon 19-09-2016 - Session 6

Lesson plan:

* Review chapter two of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#program_structure)

#### Homework:

* **Read and do exercises of chapter three** of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/03_functions.html)
    Find a way of getting exercises to me when you're done. 
    **Extra credit:** is putting it on github
* Choose a [project idea](https://josephfinlayson.github.io/coding_school_at_IXDS/lesson-1-website/) , and write in a detailed fashion how you will make it happen, then **post on slack** when you're done

Example for the project idea _'App that can read blog articles out loud.'_;

> There is a website with a single input box, that is centered inside the screen, below it is a button which says 'play', which is greyed out. I paste a web address into the input box, then the button is not greyed out any more. If I click the play button, the play button changes it's text and says stop. It starts playing the audio of the blog article. if I click the stop button the audio stops playing, and the stop button changes it's text to say play. 

* **Extra credit only if you want to and have the time** Do as much of your description as you can



## Mon 12-09-2016 - Session 5 

Lesson plan:

* Last week we created a full screen image from the NASA API and overlaid a quote from shakespeare from the wikiquote API.

* Review chapter two of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#program_structure)
* Git: Create Mars Rover repo on GitHub Pages
* Then we're going to revisit their [project ideas](https://josephfinlayson.github.io/coding_school_at_IXDS/lesson-1-website/) and work out if any of them are feasible to implement.

#### Homework:

* Look over the code you did in the lesson, Do you understand it? Write down some questions you have for the next lesson. Can you improve it now? Fix the changes and push to github (Do not spend more than 1 hour on this)
* **Read and do exercises of chapter two** of [Eloquent Javascript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/02_program_structure.html#program_structure)
    Find a way of getting exercises to me when you're done.

    * Next week we will go over these exercises so make sure you do them


<!--* Set Computers up:
    * [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) 

* If we have extra time
    * [Meteor getting started](https://www.meteor.com/tutorials/blaze/creating-an-app)
    * What is an array??? Explanation of arrays. Whiteboarding arrays -->



## Mon 29-08-2016 - Session 3

<!--What is a function?? Explanation of functions. Whiteboarding functions-->
    
* Clone [special demonstration repository](https://github.com/josephfinlayson/learning-to-ajax) (working together). 
    * Write some HTML & CSS
        * Make it look a bit better
        * Create an image
        * Create a description
      
    * Write some javascript to create interactivity

#### Homework:

* Clone [special demonstration repository](https://github.com/josephfinlayson/learning-to-ajax) and open index.html in the browser, and the folder in sublime text. Look at `main.js` and `my-styles.css`
* Using guardian data, add more of it to the HTML page by modifying addArticleToPage function, (use the body field, and the trail text especially) 
for example, add a new line that says: `$('.main').append('<div>' + article.body + '</div>')` on line 15

* Do the [CSS exercises](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/make-a-website)
* Make the webpage look like a real article, that you see on the guardian. If you need extra divs to make it easier to style, you can write more complex jQuery to nest certain styles

```javascript

    $('.main').append(
    '<div class="my-article"> ' +
        '<h2 class="my-title">' + article.webTitle + '</h2>' +
        '<p>'+ article.body + '</p>' +
     '</div>')

```

* Add the styles to `my-styles.css`
* Extra credit: Read first 2 chapters of [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net), and do exercises
